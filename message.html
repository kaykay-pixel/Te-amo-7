        <h1>My Heart’s Words for You 🤍</h1>
        <p>
            <span class="highlighted-text">My Dearest Hamoodie,</span><br><br>

One whole year. One year of loving you, of learning you, of growing alongside you, of finding pieces of myself I thought were lost forever.  <br><br>


Before you, I lived in a world where love felt like something fragile—something that could shatter at the smallest misstep. I carried scars from moments where I had been hurt, abandoned, made to feel like love was conditional, something I had to constantly prove myself worthy of. And then you came along, <b>my safe place, my healing, my home.</b>  <br><br>


From the very beginning, you didn’t just love me—you <b>showed</b> me how love should feel. You made me realize that arguments don’t mean endings, that hardship doesn’t mean walking away, that love—<b>real love</b>—chooses to stay. With every late-night conversation, every heartfelt apology, every moment where we could have given up but instead held onto each other, you <b>fixed</b> the part of my heart that believed love was fleeting.  <br><br>


I love the way you love me, Hunny. I love the tenderness in your words, the way you make me feel <b>seen, heard, understood</b>, the way you treat me like I am precious to you. I love that you have made a home in my heart, a place where I feel safe, cherished, <b>never doubted</b>. <br><br>
 

And oh, how I love you. I love your <b>eyes</b>, the way they soften when you look at me, as if I am the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen. I love your <b>smile</b>, the way it lifts my spirits, filling my heart with warmth. Your <b>goatee, your eyebrows, your nose, your ears, your hair, your body</b>—every detail, every piece of you is something I adore. But what I love most, more than anything, is <b>your heart</b>. The way you love so deeply, so fully, the way you take care of me without hesitation.  <br><br>


I have never felt this kind of love before—the kind that nurtures, the kind that teaches me that I am worthy of stability, of gentleness, of a love that does not falter. You have taken care of me in every way possible, and <b>I want to spend forever taking care of you in return</b>. I want to be the person you lean on, the one who lifts you up the way you’ve always lifted me. I want to hold your hand through every joy, every hardship, every milestone life brings our way.  <br><br>


One year down—a lifetime to go. And through every year that follows, I will love you deeper, cherish you more, and remind you, every single day, that <b>you are everything to me</b>.  <br><br>


Happy One-Year Anniversary, my love. 🤍  <br><br>


أنا نحبك بزاف,  <br>
<b>Karol ^^</b>
